# Modal Focus Behavior Test

## Changes Made

### 1. FeedingModal.vue

- **Removed**: Auto-focus on amount input field in `onMounted`
- **Before**: `amountInput.value?.focus()` was called in `nextTick`
- **After**: Removed the auto-focus call to prevent unwanted keyboard activation

### 2. ResponsiveModal.vue

- **Modified**: Focus management to focus modal container instead of first input
- **Before**: Automatically focused the first focusable element (often date inputs)
- **After**: Only focuses the modal container for accessibility without triggering input focus

## Expected Behavior After Changes

### ✅ What Should Work

1. **Modal Opening**: Modals open without automatically focusing date fields
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab key still works to navigate between fields
3. **Manual Focus**: Users can still manually tap/click on fields to focus them
4. **Accessibility**: Screen readers can still navigate the modal properly
5. **Focus Trap**: Focus is still trapped within the modal for keyboard users

### ✅ What Should NOT Happen

1. **No Auto-Focus**: Date fields don't automatically get focus when modal opens
2. **No Keyboard Pop-up**: Mobile keyboards don't automatically appear
3. **No Text Selection**: Input text isn't automatically selected on modal open

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: FeedingModal

1. Open a feeding modal
2. **Expected**: No input field should be focused
3. **Expected**: Mobile keyboard should not appear
4. **Expected**: User can manually tap amount field to focus it

### Test Case 2: Edit Modals (Nursing, Pumping, etc.)

1. Open any edit modal
2. **Expected**: Date field should not be automatically focused
3. **Expected**: Modal should be accessible but not trigger input focus
4. **Expected**: Tab navigation should work normally

### Test Case 3: Accessibility

1. Use screen reader or keyboard navigation
2. **Expected**: Modal should be announced properly
3. **Expected**: Tab key should move through focusable elements
4. **Expected**: Escape key should close modal

## Technical Details

### Focus Management Strategy

- **Modal Container Focus**: The modal container itself receives focus for accessibility
- **No Input Auto-Focus**: Input fields are not automatically focused
- **Preserved Tab Order**: Natural tab order is maintained for keyboard navigation
- **Focus Trap**: Focus is still trapped within the modal boundaries

### Benefits

1. **Better Mobile UX**: Prevents unwanted keyboard pop-ups
2. **User Control**: Users decide when to interact with inputs
3. **Accessibility Compliant**: Still meets WCAG guidelines for modal focus
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All modals behave the same way

## Files Modified

- `src/components/FeedingModal.vue`
- `src/components/ResponsiveModal.vue`

## Testing Instructions

1. Open any modal on mobile device
2. Verify keyboard doesn't automatically appear
3. Test tab navigation works properly
4. Verify manual field focusing still works
5. Test with screen reader for accessibility
