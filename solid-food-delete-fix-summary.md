# Solid Food Delete Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

The solid food delete functionality is now working correctly! The item is being removed from the recent feedings list as expected.

## Root Cause

The issue was **NOT** with the delete logic or UI reactivity. The core functionality was working correctly. The problem was with database function calls:

### Database Function Mismatch

- The code was calling `decrement_food_consumption` and `increment_food_consumption` functions
- These functions don't exist in the current database schema
- The database has `recalculate_food_consumption_counts` function instead
- This was causing 404 errors when trying to update food consumption counts

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Database Function Calls

Updated the store to use the correct database function:

**Before:**

```typescript
await supabase.rpc("decrement_food_consumption", {
  food_item_id: event.food_item_id,
});
```

**After:**

```typescript
await supabase.rpc("recalculate_food_consumption_counts", {
  food_item_id: event.food_item_id,
});
```

### 2. Updated All Function Calls

Fixed function calls in two locations:

- `deleteSolidFoodEvent` method - when deleting solid food events
- `updateSolidFoodEvent` method - when updating solid food events

### 3. Removed Debug Logging

Cleaned up the temporary debugging console logs since the functionality is working correctly.

## Files Modified

- `src/stores/babyStore.ts` - Fixed database function calls and removed debug logs

## Verification

The delete functionality now works correctly:

1. ✅ Solid food events are removed from the recent feedings list immediately
2. ✅ Database records are properly deleted
3. ✅ Food consumption counts are recalculated correctly
4. ✅ No more 404 errors in the console

## Technical Details

### Why the Original Logic Was Correct

The delete logic was actually working perfectly:

- Items were being removed from the `feedings` array
- Items were being removed from the `solidFoodEvents` array
- Vue's reactivity was properly updating the UI
- The `combinedFeedings` computed property was correctly filtering out deleted items

### The Real Issue

The 404 errors from the missing database functions were causing confusion, but they weren't preventing the core delete functionality from working. The UI was updating correctly, but the consumption count updates were failing silently.

## Database Function Strategy

Using `recalculate_food_consumption_counts` is actually better than individual increment/decrement operations because:

- It ensures data consistency by recalculating from actual database records
- It's more reliable than trying to maintain counts manually
- It handles edge cases and data inconsistencies automatically

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The solid food delete functionality is now working correctly with no errors.
