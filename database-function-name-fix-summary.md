# Database Function Name Fix - Final Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

The database function name was incorrect. The code was calling `recalculate_food_consumption_counts` but the actual function name in the database is `recalculate_food_consumption` (without the `_counts` suffix).

## Error Message

```
POST https://cnkrdfrtjpupycshlwlm.supabase.co/rest/v1/rpc/recalculate_food_consumption_counts 404 (Not Found)
Could not find the function public.recalculate_food_consumption_counts(food_item_id) in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause

Looking at the migration file `supabase/migrations/020_add_food_consumption_functions.sql`, the actual function is defined as:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_food_consumption(food_item_id UUID)
```

Not `recalculate_food_consumption_counts` as the code was calling.

## Fix Applied

Updated all database function calls from:

```typescript
await supabase.rpc("recalculate_food_consumption_counts", {
  food_item_id: foodItemId,
});
```

To:

```typescript
await supabase.rpc("recalculate_food_consumption", {
  food_item_id: foodItemId,
});
```

## Functions Fixed

Updated 4 locations in `src/stores/babyStore.ts`:

1. `createSolidFoodEvent` method - when creating new solid food events
2. `updateSolidFoodEvent` method - when removing foods from events
3. `updateSolidFoodEvent` method - when adding foods to events
4. `deleteSolidFoodEvent` method - when deleting solid food events

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

All database function calls now use the correct function name that exists in your database. You should no longer see any 404 errors when:

- ✅ Adding solid food events
- ✅ Editing solid food events
- ✅ Deleting solid food events
- ✅ Food consumption counts will be properly recalculated

## What the Function Does

The `recalculate_food_consumption` function:

- Counts actual solid food events in the database for a specific food item
- Updates the `times_consumed` count to match the actual count
- Updates `first_tried_date` and `last_tried_date` based on actual events
- Ensures data consistency even if there were previous errors

This approach is more reliable than trying to manually increment/decrement counters.
