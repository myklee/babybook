# Pumping Timer Accessibility Test Results

## Overview
This document verifies the accessibility improvements implemented for the pumping timer feature.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. ARIA Labels and Screen Reader Support ✅
- **PumpingTimerModal**: Added proper `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-live` attributes
- **PumpingEditModal**: Enhanced form fields with `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`
- **DualBreastTimer**: Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for collapsible sections
- **Timeline**: Added `role="button"` and `aria-label` for pumping markers
- **HistoryList**: Added keyboard navigation and descriptive `aria-label` for pumping sessions

### 2. Keyboard Navigation ✅
- **Modal Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping and restoration
- **Tab Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Enter/Space Support**: Timeline markers and history items support keyboard activation
- **Escape Key**: Closes modals consistently

### 3. Screen Reader Only Content ✅

- Help text for form fields explaining their purpose
- Character counters with live updates
- Validation error announcements

### 4. Focus Management ✅
- **Modal Opening**: Focus moves to first interactive element
- **Modal Closing**: Focus returns to triggering element
- **Focus Indicators**: Enhanced focus outlines with 3px solid borders
- **Focus Trapping**: Tab navigation stays within modal

### 5. Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility ✅
- **High Contrast Mode**: Added `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` support
- **Focus Indicators**: High contrast yellow (#ffff00) focus indicators
- **Error States**: Clear visual and programmatic error indication
- **Status Updates**: Live regions for dynamic content updates

### 6. Responsive Design and Touch Targets ✅
- **Minimum Touch Targets**: 44px minimum height for buttons (inherited from global styles)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive layouts for small screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Proper spacing and sizing for mobile interaction

### 7. Reduced Motion Support ✅
- **Motion Preferences**: Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` support
- **Animation Disable**: Transitions disabled for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Transform Disable**: Modal entrance animations respect motion preferences

## Testing Checklist

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] VoiceOver (macOS): Test modal announcements and navigation
- [ ] NVDA (Windows): Verify form field descriptions and error messages
- [ ] JAWS (Windows): Test live region updates and button descriptions

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
- [x] Tab through all interactive elements in correct order
- [x] Enter/Space activate buttons and interactive elements
- [x] Escape closes modals and returns focus
- [x] Focus visible on all interactive elements

### Visual Testing
- [x] High contrast mode displays correctly
- [x] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [x] Text has sufficient color contrast
- [x] Error states are visually distinct

### Mobile Testing
- [x] Touch targets are at least 44px
- [x] Modal layouts work on small screens
- [x] Text remains readable at mobile sizes
- [x] Interactions work with touch input

## Implementation Details

### Key Components Enhanced
1. **PumpingTimerModal.vue**: Main pumping timer interface
2. **PumpingEditModal.vue**: Edit existing pumping sessions
3. **DualBreastTimer.vue**: Timer controls component
4. **Timeline.vue**: Timeline display of pumping events
5. **HistoryList.vue**: History list with pumping sessions

### Accessibility Patterns Used
- **Live Regions**: `aria-live="polite"` for status updates, `aria-live="assertive"` for errors
- **Form Labels**: Proper `<label>` elements with `for` attributes
- **Descriptive Text**: `aria-describedby` linking to help text
- **State Indication**: `aria-invalid` for form validation errors
- **Expandable Content**: `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for collapsible sections

### CSS Accessibility Features
- **Screen Reader Only**: `.sr-only` class for hidden descriptive content
- **Focus Indicators**: Enhanced focus outlines with sufficient contrast
- **High Contrast**: Specialized styles for high contrast mode
- **Reduced Motion**: Disabled animations for motion-sensitive users

## Compliance Standards
This implementation follows:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- **Section 508**: US Federal accessibility requirements
- **ARIA 1.1**: Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification

## Next Steps
1. Conduct user testing with screen reader users
2. Perform automated accessibility testing with tools like axe-core
3. Test with various assistive technologies
4. Gather feedback from users with disabilities
