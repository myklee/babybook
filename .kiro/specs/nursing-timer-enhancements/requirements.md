# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nursing Timer Enhancements feature will complete the nursing duration tracking system by adding history display updates, analytics components, session management improvements, and mobile optimizations. This builds upon the core nursing timer functionality to provide a comprehensive nursing tracking experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to see nursing sessions displayed with duration information in my feeding history, so that I can review past nursing sessions with meaningful duration data instead of volume amounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing feeding history THEN nursing sessions SHALL display duration (e.g., "18 minutes") instead of volume amounts
2. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN nursing sessions SHALL show duration, breast information, and session status
3. WHEN viewing daily summaries THEN nursing sessions SHALL be included with total nursing time and session counts
4. WHEN editing a nursing record THEN the system SHALL allow modification of duration, breast selection, and notes
5. WHEN exporting feeding data THEN nursing sessions SHALL include start time, end time, duration, and breast information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to see comprehensive nursing analytics and insights, so that I can understand my baby's nursing patterns and share meaningful data with healthcare providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing nursing analytics THEN the system SHALL display average session duration, total nursing time, and session frequency
2. WHEN viewing breast usage analytics THEN the system SHALL show left vs right breast balance with visual charts
3. WHEN viewing weekly patterns THEN the system SHALL identify peak nursing hours and duration trends
4. WHEN viewing nursing insights THEN the system SHALL provide personalized suggestions based on nursing patterns
5. WHEN generating nursing reports THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive summaries suitable for healthcare visits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want robust session management and recovery, so that my nursing sessions are preserved even if the app is interrupted or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is backgrounded during a nursing session THEN the timer SHALL continue running accurately
2. WHEN the app crashes or is force-closed THEN active nursing sessions SHALL be recovered on restart
3. WHEN a nursing session exceeds 2 hours THEN the system SHALL prompt to confirm the session is still active
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN nursing session data SHALL be queued and synced when connection is restored
5. WHEN multiple devices are used THEN nursing session state SHALL be synchronized across all devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a nursing parent using a mobile device, I want optimized touch interactions and accessibility features, so that I can easily manage nursing sessions with one hand while nursing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the nursing timer on mobile THEN all controls SHALL have large, easy-to-tap touch targets
2. WHEN operating with one hand THEN the most common actions SHALL be easily reachable with thumb navigation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all nursing timer elements SHALL have proper accessibility labels and announcements
4. WHEN in high contrast mode THEN the nursing timer SHALL maintain clear visual distinction between elements
5. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the nursing timer layout SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that my nursing data is always accurate and I receive helpful guidance when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to start multiple nursing sessions THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts and provide clear error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur during session management THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline capabilities
3. WHEN invalid nursing data is entered THEN the system SHALL provide specific validation feedback and correction suggestions
4. WHEN session data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and notify the user of any data loss
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the user SHALL receive user-friendly error messages with actionable next steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want comprehensive testing and performance optimization, so that the nursing timer is reliable, fast, and works consistently across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the nursing timer THEN all timer calculations SHALL be accurate to within 1 second over extended periods
2. WHEN multiple nursing sessions are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain fast query performance for analytics
3. WHEN the nursing timer is active THEN battery usage SHALL be optimized to minimize device drain
4. WHEN switching between app views THEN nursing timer state SHALL be preserved without performance degradation
5. WHEN stress testing with many nursing sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
