# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nursing Duration Timer feature provides individual breast timers that can be independently started, paused, and stopped to accurately track nursing duration for each breast. This simplified approach allows parents to easily track nursing sessions with precise timing for left and right breasts separately, then save both durations together as a single nursing session.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to use individual timers for each breast that I can toggle on and off independently, so that I can accurately track nursing time for each breast during a session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Nursing" button THEN the system SHALL display individual timer controls for left and right breasts
2. WHEN I click a breast timer button THEN the system SHALL start timing for that specific breast
3. WHEN I click an active breast timer button THEN the system SHALL pause that specific breast timer
4. WHEN I click a paused breast timer button THEN the system SHALL resume timing for that breast
5. WHEN I click end session, active timers will be stopped and the data will be saved. 

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to see real-time duration for each breast timer, so that I can monitor how long I've been nursing on each side during the session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a breast timer is active THEN the system SHALL display the elapsed time in real-time for that breast
2. WHEN a breast timer is paused THEN the system SHALL show the paused duration and indicate the paused state
3. WHEN viewing both timers THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between left and right breast timers
4. WHEN timers are running THEN the system SHALL update the display every second with accurate timing
5. WHEN I navigate away from the timer THEN the timers SHALL continue running in the background

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to save both breast durations as a single nursing session, so that I can record the complete nursing session with accurate timing for each breast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click save THEN the system SHALL record both left and right breast durations in a single nursing session
2. WHEN saving a session THEN the system SHALL determine which breast(s) were used based on timer durations
3. WHEN only one breast timer was used THEN the system SHALL record the session for that specific breast
4. WHEN both breast timers were used THEN the system SHALL record the session as "both breasts"
5. WHEN saving THEN the system SHALL allow me to add optional notes about the nursing session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want to see nursing sessions in my history with duration information, so that I can review past nursing sessions with meaningful timing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing feeding history THEN nursing sessions SHALL display total duration and breast information
2. WHEN a session used both breasts THEN the system SHALL show individual durations for left and right
3. WHEN a session used one breast THEN the system SHALL show the duration for that specific breast
4. WHEN viewing nursing history THEN the system SHALL display sessions with clear breast indicators and timing
5. WHEN exporting data THEN nursing sessions SHALL include all duration and breast usage information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a nursing parent, I want basic nursing analytics, so that I can understand nursing patterns and breast usage balance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing nursing analytics THEN the system SHALL show total nursing time and average session duration
2. WHEN viewing breast usage analytics THEN the system SHALL show balance between left and right breast usage
3. WHEN viewing daily summaries THEN the system SHALL show total nursing sessions and combined duration
4. WHEN viewing weekly patterns THEN the system SHALL show nursing frequency trends
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include nursing duration statistics and breast usage patterns
