# Design System Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application has a foundational design system with consolidated CSS variables and theme support. This feature will implement theme switching UI and migrate existing components to use design system variables for consistent styling across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between light and dark themes, so that I can use the app in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for Light, Dark, and Auto themes
2. WHEN I select a theme THEN the system SHALL apply it immediately across the entire application
3. WHEN I select "Auto" theme THEN the system SHALL respect my device's system preference
4. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL remember my theme preference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components to have consistent styling and colors, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any component THEN it SHALL use design system color variables instead of hardcoded colors
2. WHEN I switch themes THEN all components SHALL update their colors appropriately
3. WHEN I interact with buttons, forms, and other elements THEN they SHALL have consistent styling patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic component templates with design system integration, so that I can build new features consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create new components THEN I SHALL have access to standardized design tokens
2. WHEN I need common UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide reusable components with built-in theme support
3. WHEN I implement forms THEN the system SHALL provide consistent input and label styling
