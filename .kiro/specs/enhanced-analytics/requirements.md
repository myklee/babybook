#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing correlation analysis THEN the system SHALL show relationships between feeding times and sleep quality
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL identify connections between feeding amounts and sleep duration
3. WHEN viewing insights THEN the system SHALL highlight how diaper patterns relate to feeding and health
4. WHEN examining correlations THEN the system SHALL show how solid food introduction affects sleep and digestion
5. WHEN viewing relationship data THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights based on identified patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to generate comprehensive reports for healthcare visits, so that I can provide detailed, professional summaries of my baby's patterns to pediatricians.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a healthcare report THEN the system SHALL create a professional PDF with key metrics and charts

3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL allow custom date ranges relevant to the appointment
4. WHEN sharing with providers THEN the system SHALL include both summary statistics and detailed daily logs
5. WHEN generating medical reports THEN the system SHALL highlight any concerning patterns or significant changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to receive intelligent insights and suggestions, so that I can optimize my baby's care routine based on data-driven recommendations.

3. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL identify potential issues early (like feeding difficulties or sleep disruptions)
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind each suggestion
5. WHEN viewing insights THEN the system SHALL allow me to mark suggestions as helpful or dismiss them

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to compare my baby's patterns with developmental milestones and typical ranges, so that I can understand if my baby's development is on track.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show how my baby's patterns compare to typical ranges for their age
2. WHEN analyzing development THEN the system SHALL highlight achievements and milestones reached
3. WHEN viewing comparisons THEN the system SHALL provide context about normal variation in baby development
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL show positive changes and improvements over time
5. WHEN viewing developmental data THEN the system SHALL emphasize that every baby develops at their own pace

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to export and backup my analytics data, so that I can preserve important insights and share data across different platforms or with multiple caregivers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting analytics THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options (PDF, CSV, JSON)
2. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL include all raw data and calculated insights
3. WHEN sharing analytics THEN the system SHALL allow selective sharing of specific metrics or time periods
