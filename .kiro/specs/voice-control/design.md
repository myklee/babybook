# Voice Control - Design Document

## Overview

This feature adds voice control capabilities to the baby tracking app using the Web Speech API. Parents can use simple voice commands to record activities hands-free, with visual feedback and error handling.

## Architecture

### Browser API Integration

**Web Speech API:**

- Use `SpeechRecognition` for voice input
- Implement continuous listening mode
- Handle browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Graceful fallback when not supported

### Voice Command Processing

**Command Parser:**

- Pattern matching for common phrases
- Extract amounts, types, and food names from speech
- Support natural language variations
- Case-insensitive command recognition

## Components and Interfaces

### New Components

**VoiceControlButton.vue:**

- Floating action button with microphone icon
- Visual states: idle, listening, processing, error
- Pulse animation when listening
- Accessibility support for screen readers

**VoiceCommandProcessor.ts:**

- Parse voice input into actionable commands
- Map commands to app functions
- Handle command parameters (amounts, types)
- Provide command suggestions and help

### Modified Components

**HomePage.vue:**

- Add voice control button to main interface
- Integrate voice commands with existing action buttons
- Show voice feedback messages

**Modal Components:**

- Auto-populate fields based on voice input
- Support voice-triggered modal opening
- Voice confirmation for saving actions

## Data Models

### Voice Command Interface

```typescript
interface VoiceCommand {
  action: "feeding" | "diaper" | "sleep" | "solid" | "cancel";
  type?: "breast" | "formula" | "pee" | "poop" | "nursing";
  amount?: number;
  foodName?: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

### Voice State Management

```typescript
interface VoiceState {
  isListening: boolean;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  lastCommand?: string;
  error?: string;
  isSupported: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Browser Compatibility

- Check for Web Speech API support
- Show helpful message if not supported
- Graceful degradation to touch-only interface

### Voice Recognition Errors

- Handle network connectivity issues
- Manage microphone permission requests
- Provide clear error messages for failed recognition
- Offer alternative input methods

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test command parsing logic
- Test voice state management
- Test browser API integration
- Mock speech recognition for testing

### Integration Tests

- Test voice commands trigger correct actions
- Test modal auto-population
- Test error handling flows
- Test accessibility features

### User Acceptance Tests

- Parent can record feeding with voice
- Voice commands work in noisy environments
- Visual feedback is clear and helpful
- Commands work with natural speech patterns
