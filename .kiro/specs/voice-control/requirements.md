# Voice Control - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Parents often have their hands full when caring for babies, making it difficult to interact with touch interfaces. This feature adds voice control capabilities to enable hands-free recording of baby activities using simple voice commands.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parent with my hands full, I want to record baby activities using voice commands, so that I can track feedings, diaper changes, and sleep without touching my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "Record breast feeding" THEN the app SHALL open the breast feeding modal
2. WHEN I say "Record formula feeding" THEN the app SHALL open the formula feeding modal
3. WHEN I say "Record diaper change" THEN the app SHALL open the diaper modal
4. WHEN I say "Baby is sleeping" THEN the app SHALL start a sleep session
5. WHEN I say "Baby woke up" THEN the app SHALL end the current sleep session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent, I want voice commands to work with specific amounts and details, so that I can provide complete information without touching the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I say "Record poop diaper" THEN the app SHALL select poop as the diaper type

4. WHEN I say "Record solid food banana" THEN the app SHALL pre-fill banana as the food name
5. WHEN voice commands include amounts or types THEN the app SHALL auto-populate the relevant fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent, I want voice control to be easily accessible and provide feedback, so that I know when the app is listening and when commands are recognized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap the voice control button THEN the app SHALL start listening for commands
2. WHEN the app is listening THEN it SHALL show a visual indicator (microphone icon or animation)
3. WHEN a command is recognized THEN the app SHALL provide audio or visual feedback
