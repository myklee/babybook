  - Add interactive filtering and date range selection
  - Implement responsive design for mobile viewing
  - Include printable summary reports
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

## Technical Requirements

### Store Methods to Implement

- `getFoodConsumptionStats(babyId: string, dateRange?: DateRange): FoodConsumptionAnalytics`
- `getMostConsumedFoods(babyId: string, limit?: number): UserFoodItem[]`
- `getRecentlyIntroducedFoods(babyId: string, days?: number): UserFoodItem[]`
- `getFoodsByReaction(babyId: string): Record<string, UserFoodItem[]>`
- `getFoodConsumptionTrends(babyId: string, dateRange: DateRange): ConsumptionTrend[]`

### Components to Create

- `FoodAnalyticsDashboard.vue` - Main analytics dashboard
- `FoodStatisticsCard.vue` - Individual statistic display cards
- `FoodConsumptionChart.vue` - Chart component for consumption data
- `FoodPreferenceBreakdown.vue` - Preference analysis display
- `FoodMilestoneTracker.vue` - Milestone tracking component

### Types to Define

- `FoodConsumptionAnalytics` - Overall analytics data structure
- `ConsumptionTrend` - Trend data for charts
- `FoodMilestone` - Milestone tracking data
- `AnalyticsFilter` - Filtering options for analytics

## Dependencies

This feature depends on:

- Completed solid food improvements implementation
- Chart.js or similar charting library for data visualization
- Date range picker component
- Export functionality (PDF/CSV generation)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Parents can view comprehensive statistics about their baby's solid food journey
- [ ] Analytics provide actionable insights about food preferences and patterns
- [ ] Dashboard is responsive and accessible on all devices
- [ ] Data can be exported for sharing with healthcare providers
- [ ] Performance remains good with large datasets (1000+ food events)

## Notes

This feature is designed to be implemented after the core solid food improvements are complete and stable. It provides valuable insights but is not critical for basic functionality.
