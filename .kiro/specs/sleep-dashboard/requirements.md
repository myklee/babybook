# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sleep Dashboard feature will provide comprehensive sleep tracking and analytics for babies, building upon the existing basic sleep session functionality. This feature will help parents understand their baby's sleep patterns, track sleep quality, and identify trends that can improve both baby's and parents' sleep quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to view a dedicated sleep dashboard, so that I can quickly see my baby's current sleep status and recent sleep patterns in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the sleep dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the current sleep status (sleeping/awake)
2. WHEN my baby is currently sleeping THEN the system SHALL show elapsed sleep time in real-time
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display today's total sleep time and number of sleep sessions
4. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show the last 7 days of sleep patterns in a visual chart
5. WHEN my baby is awake THEN the system SHALL show time since last sleep and suggest optimal next sleep time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to distinguish between naps and nighttime sleep, so that I can track different sleep patterns and understand my baby's sleep schedule better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a sleep session THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize as "Nap" or "Night Sleep" based on time of day
2. WHEN viewing sleep history THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between naps and night sleep with different visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing sleep analytics THEN the system SHALL show separate statistics for naps vs night sleep
4. WHEN a sleep session starts between 7 PM and 6 AM THEN the system SHALL categorize it as "Night Sleep"
5. WHEN editing a sleep record THEN the system SHALL allow me to change the sleep type (Nap/Night Sleep)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to track sleep quality and conditions, so that I can identify what helps my baby sleep better and share detailed information with healthcare providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ending a sleep session THEN the system SHALL prompt me to rate sleep quality (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
2. WHEN logging sleep THEN the system SHALL allow me to note sleep conditions (room temperature, noise level, feeding before sleep)
3. WHEN viewing sleep history THEN the system SHALL display sleep quality ratings with color-coded indicators
4. WHEN viewing sleep analytics THEN the system SHALL show average sleep quality trends over time
5. WHEN adding sleep notes THEN the system SHALL provide quick-select options for common observations (restless, peaceful, woke frequently, slept through)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to see sleep pattern analytics and insights, so that I can understand my baby's sleep development and optimize sleep schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing sleep analytics THEN the system SHALL display average sleep duration for naps and night sleep
2. WHEN viewing weekly patterns THEN the system SHALL show sleep timing consistency and duration trends
3. WHEN viewing sleep insights THEN the system SHALL identify patterns like optimal bedtime or longest sleep stretches
4. WHEN viewing monthly summaries THEN the system SHALL show sleep development progress and changes over time
5. WHEN sleep patterns are irregular THEN the system SHALL provide gentle suggestions for sleep schedule optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to receive sleep-related notifications and reminders, so that I can maintain consistent sleep schedules and be alerted to unusual patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my baby has been awake for an unusually long time THEN the system SHALL suggest it might be nap time
2. WHEN approaching typical bedtime THEN the system SHALL send a gentle bedtime reminder
3. WHEN sleep patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL notify me of the change
4. WHEN my baby has been sleeping for an unusually long time THEN the system SHALL provide a gentle check-in notification
5. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL allow me to customize which sleep alerts I want to receive

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to export sleep data and generate sleep reports, so that I can share comprehensive sleep information with pediatricians and track long-term progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a sleep report THEN the system SHALL include daily sleep totals, average durations, and quality ratings
2. WHEN exporting sleep data THEN the system SHALL provide options for different date ranges (week, month, custom)
3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL include visual charts showing sleep patterns and trends
4. WHEN sharing with healthcare providers THEN the system SHALL generate a professional summary format
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all sleep sessions with timestamps, durations, quality, and notes
