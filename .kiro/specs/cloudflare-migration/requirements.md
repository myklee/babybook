# Cloudflare Migration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The baby tracking app currently uses Supabase for database, authentication, and file storage. This migration will move to Cloudflare's ecosystem using R2 for storage, D1 for database, Workers for API, and other Cloudflare services for a more cost-effective and performant solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Supabase to Cloudflare services, so that I can reduce costs and improve global performance while maintaining all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data SHALL be preserved and accessible
2. WHEN users access the app THEN they SHALL experience no loss of functionality
3. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL use Cloudflare D1 database instead of Supabase PostgreSQL
4. WHEN users authenticate THEN they SHALL use Cloudflare Access or Workers Auth instead of Supabase Auth
5. WHEN baby images are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in Cloudflare R2 instead of Supabase Storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless data migration, so that all my baby tracking history is preserved during the platform change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration runs THEN all baby profiles SHALL be transferred to the new system
2. WHEN the migration runs THEN all feeding records SHALL be preserved with correct timestamps
3. WHEN the migration runs THEN all diaper changes SHALL be migrated accurately
4. WHEN the migration runs THEN all sleep sessions SHALL be transferred completely
5. WHEN the migration runs THEN all user preferences SHALL be maintained
6. WHEN the migration runs THEN all baby images SHALL be copied to R2 with correct URLs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain API compatibility, so that the frontend code requires minimal changes during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use the same interface patterns as before
2. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL return the same data structures
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with current patterns
4. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN they SHALL work through Cloudflare Workers WebSockets
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing auth flows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want improved performance and cost efficiency, so that the app scales better and costs less to operate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the app globally THEN they SHALL experience faster load times through Cloudflare's edge network
2. WHEN the system handles traffic THEN it SHALL cost significantly less than Supabase
3. WHEN data is queried THEN it SHALL perform at least as fast as the current system
4. WHEN files are served THEN they SHALL be delivered through Cloudflare's CDN
5. WHEN the system scales THEN it SHALL handle increased load automatically
